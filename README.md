## Overview
This repository contains all the projects I completed as part of my HTML and CSS course.  
The purpose of this course was to build a strong foundation in front-end web development by learning how to create well-structured, responsive, and visually appealing websites using modern HTML and CSS practices.

Each project in this repository demonstrates the skills and concepts I learned throughout the course and shows my progress from basic web pages to more advanced layouts.
